    # If this field is not included, the reward day will default to Page 1
    GUI Page: 1


# This config file contains a default of 30 days of rewards. You may copy/delete fields to ensure that your server has more or less rewards.
# Not filling out days will not remove the day, but instead default the day to not giving out any reward
# The built-in placeholder <playerName> can be used in the RewardCommand section of the day to specify the player who redeems the rewards in game name
